A tool for small teams to share and automatically update Apache2
configurations for OS X.

sharedwebconfig.py is a command-line executable python program.

Its purpose is to update an Apache conf file if it has changed 
on a central server somewhere. Before checking other files, it 
will try to update itself. All file locations and URLs can be 
configured by modifying the first few lines of the program.

Depending on the files to be updated, it may need to run as root:
	sudo sharedwebconfig.py

Before running, be sure to alter "config.py" to use the right
paths for your particular setup.


FUTURE TASKS AND GOALS:
Create a launchd item that will automatically run each day.
