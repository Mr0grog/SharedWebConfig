A tool for small teams to share and automatically update Apache2
configurations for OS X.

sharedwebconfig.py is a command-line executable python program.

Its purpose is to update an Apache config file and the hosts
file if they have changed on a central server somewhere. Before
checking other files, it will try to update itself. All file
locations and URLs can be configured by modifying the first
few lines of the program.

Depending on the files to be updated, it may need to run as root:
	sudo sharedwebconfig.py


FUTURE TASKS AND GOALS:
Create a launchd item that will automatically run each day.
